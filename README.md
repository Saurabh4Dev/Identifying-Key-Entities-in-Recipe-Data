# Identifying Key Entities in Recipe Data

# Business Objective
> 
The business objective is to leverage the increasing popularity of online cooking platforms and meal-planning apps by enhancing the user experience.This can be achieved by implementing a custom-named entity recognition (NER) model to automatically tag ingredients, quantities and recipe names. This automation will streamline the process of organising recipes, improve searchability and enable users to easily find recipes based on available ingredients, portion sizes or specific dietary requirements. This will ultimately reduce the labour-intensive and inefficient manual tagging process, providing a more accessible and efficient way for businesses in the food and recipe industry to manage their recipe databases.

## General Information


Problem Statement: The model will classify words into predefined categories such as ingredients, quantities and units, enabling the creation of a structured database of recipes and ingredients that can be used to power advanced features in recipe management systems, dietary tracking apps, or e-commerce platforms.


Solution: Report file is atrtached to provide a walfthrough of the code and methodology used. Code file is well commented to provide details of steps performed.



## Technologies Used
Python 3.10.4
jupyter notebook

## conclusions
Developed Named Entity Recognition (NER) model using Conditional Random Fields (CRF) to achieve this objective that can identify key entities in Recipe Data.
